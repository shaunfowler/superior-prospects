                I have been interested in rocks since the age of seven and have
                been a member of several rock and mineral clubs providing me
                with numerous field trips rock-hounding. During the summer of
                1980 I worked at the Detour Lake mine for J.S. Redpath. In the
                fall of 1980, I attended Carleton University in Ottawa to pursue
                a Bachelor of Science degree, geology major. My return to the
                work force in 1981 prevented my continuation of this post
                secondary education.

                I moved to Marathon in 1982 to do some prospecting with my
                grandfather Arthur Wright during the Hemlo rush. My grandfather
                was instrumental in my initial interest as a rock collector,
                having been involved in the mining industry all his life.

                In October 1982, I hired on with David Bell, who was then
                conducting a drill program on the Goliath/Golden Sceptre
                properties in the Hemlo camp. My chief duties involved core
                splitting and shipping rock samples. In November, Noranda
                Exploration took over the project and I was transferred to their
                payroll. For the next two years I performed a number of duties
                such as core splitting, soil sampling and down hole surveying.
                In February 1985 the exploration boom was over, so I took up
                permanent employment with the David Bell mine, now owned and
                operated by Barrick/Teck-Cominco. I worked at the mine for three
                years as a shipper/receiver. In December 1988, I changed
                employers and began working for Marathon Pulp, the local pulp
                mill. My employment ended when the mill shut down in March 2009
                and I moved to Pinawa, Manitoba, where I currently work for
                Atomic Energy of Canada.

                During the period from 1982-2009, I have actively explored the
                Schreiber-Hemlo greenstone belt searching for both precious and
                base metals. During the summer months a Thunder Bay District
                Ministry geologist would visit the MNDM's satellite office in
                Marathon. I would take that opportunity to visit them with
                samples I'd collected and listen to their advice. Over the
                years, I have attended prospecting courses and participated in
                the Prospectors Tent at the annual Mining Symposium in Thunder
                Bay. I have visited and gone underground at all three Hemlo gold
                mines, the Geco base metal mine and the Winston Lake base metal
                mine.

                I have gathered a good sound knowledge of mining exploration and
                gained invaluable advice from numerous Company and Ministry
                geologists. Having spent the majority of my time in the
                Schreiber-Hemlo belt, I am very familiar with the geology and
                showings from White River in the east, to Schreiber in the west
                and Manitouwadge in the north. I use this to my advantage to
                acquire properties in the belt with good potential for both base
                metal and precious metal discoveries.
